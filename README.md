# metoffice_datahub
Scripts to download and process observation data from The Metoffice data hub

This is a new version of the project https://github.com/ukfh/weather which had to be retired due to the Metoffice retiring datapoint.
The data now comes from https://datahub.metoffice.gov.uk/ using a free account.

The data can be viewed in streamlit at: https://metofficedatacheck.streamlit.app/
